# Cryptocurrencies

### Overview
  - This week I am working with Martha and researching cryptocurrencies along with there value, trading, total coins minted, total coin supply, coin name and lastly the algorithm used to mine the coin. Along with those descripters we clean the table up and making it easier to read. After that we reduced the data dimensions using the PCA method and then clustered the cryptocurrencies using K-Means and finding the best value for K using the elbow curve. In all I belive we were able to really deep dive into the world of cryptocurrencies and find similarities with each coin and how they all compare.
